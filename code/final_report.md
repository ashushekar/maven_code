# Research Report


## Executive Summary
Executive Summary
This report synthesizes climate change adaptation strategies across risk assessment, sector-specific options, governance and financing, and monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL). A core finding is that robust risk assessments—integrating hazards, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity with downscaled climate projections (SSP-RCP) and transparent uncertainty—are essential to prioritize actions across places and sectors. Sector analyses show a broad menu of context-specific options in agriculture, water resources, urban infrastructure, health, and coastal systems; nature-based solutions (NbS) often offer co-benefits but require enabling governance and finance to scale. Governance and financing emerge as critical enablers: integrated policy mixes, regulatory and market-based instruments, concessional and blended financing, and strengthened multi-level coordination are needed to translate planning into action. MEL frameworks, anchored by theory of change and results-based monitoring, guide learning, attribution, and reporting for accountability under international transparency regimes. Across sectors, leveraging adaptation–mitigation co-benefits and using decision-support tools (CRIDA, CLIMADA, ND-GAIN, AdapteCCa) support robust, context-specific decision-making.

## Key Findings
Key Findings
- A coherent risk-assessment framework that combines hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity with downscaled projections is foundational for prioritizing adaptation actions across geographies and sectors.
- Sector-specific options exist in agriculture, water, urban infrastructure, health, and coastal systems; effectiveness is highly context-dependent, with NbS offering co-benefits but requiring governance and finance to scale.
- Governance and financing are central bottlenecks; effective action depends on integrated policy mixes, multi-actor coordination, and innovative financing (blended/concessional) to mobilize public and private investment.
- Monitoring, evaluation, and learning are essential to attribute results, adapt strategies, and report progress; theory-of-change–based MEL with RBM/logframes and learning loops supports iterative improvement.
- Data gaps and reporting needs persist (hazard inventories, indicators, finance flows); standardized metrics and alignment with UNFCCC transparency requirements are needed to enable comparability and learning.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Risk assessment for climate change adaptation: vulnerability, exposure, and adaptive capacity
Topic: Risk assessment for climate change adaptation: vulnerability, exposure, and adaptive capacity

Overview
Climate risk assessments for adaptation aim to identify where climate change will affect sectors and geographies, quantify potential impacts, and guide prioritized actions. A robust framework integrates climate scenarios (including downscaled projections), well-defined indicators of exposure, sensitivity (or vulnerability), and adaptive capacity, and a decision framework that prioritizes actions across places and sectors. This section synthesizes current concepts and methods from IPCC guidance, vulnerability frameworks, and practical risk-assessment tools, with attention to how to scale assessments from local to regional and sectoral levels.

1) Conceptual foundations: vulnerability, exposure, adaptive capacity, and risk
- Core definitions and relationships
  - Vulnerability in climate risk literature is commonly treated as a function of exposure, sensitivity (or a related concept), and adaptive capacity. Exposure refers to the degree to which a system experiences climate-related hazards; sensitivity describes how strongly a system responds to those hazards; adaptive capacity is the ability to adjust to hazards, moderate potential damages, and take advantage of opportunities (or reduce harm) over time. The IPCC’s framing emphasizes that risk results from interactions among hazards, exposure, and vulnerability, where vulnerability is shaped by sensitivity and adaptive capacity (IPCC AR6 WG2 and associated risk guidance) (IPCC AR6 WG2; The concept of risk in IPCC AR6; 2. Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability) [sources listed below].
  - In SREX-era terminology, vulnerability is described as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity; adaptive capacity represents a system’s preconditions to cope with change and to adjust in anticipation or in response to change (IPCC SREX Ch. 2; TAR/AR definitions). This framing remains central in AR6 and subsequent vulnerability assessments (IPCC AR6 WG2; 2 - Determinants of Risk) [sources listed below].
  - Practical vulnerability assessments often use a three-element framework (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity) or pairings (e.g., exposure + adaptive capacity, or exposure + sensitivity) depending on data availability and sectoral focus. Contemporary reviews show both three-element and two-element configurations; guidance emphasizes transparent documentation of choices and uncertainties (Exposure, sensitivity, or adaptive capacity? Reviewing assessments; Advancing vulnerability concepts) [sources listed below].
- Why this matters for adaptation planning
  - The literature emphasizes that reducing vulnerability (especially through increasing adaptive capacity and reducing exposure to hazard coincidences) yields substantial risk reductions for near-term climate impacts, with a growing emphasis on place-based and sector-specific drivers (IPCC AR6 Africa/Asia chapters; Complex vulnerability framing in Africa; vulnerability frameworks update) [sources listed below].
  - A risk-based lens helps prioritize actions where hazard exposure and vulnerability converge on high-value assets or critical services (e.g., water, health, transportation, energy) (AdapteCCa risk framework; ND-GAIN indicators; CRIDA in water planning) [sources listed below].

2) Climate scenarios, downscaling, and how to project future hazards
- Climate scenarios and SSP-RCP framing
  - AR6 uses SSP-based socio-economic pathways plus climate forcings (SSP-RCP combinations) to describe plausible futures. Multiple scenarios are employed to explore a range of potential climate responses and socio-economic conditions, enabling robust decision making under uncertainty [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: SSP-RCP scenarios; AR6 context] [sources listed below].
- Downscaling and regional projections
  - Downscaling approaches are essential for sector- and geography-specific risk assessments. Dynamical downscaling (e.g., CORDEX) provides regionally refined projections from CMIP6 ensembles; bias correction and distributional mapping (e.g., quantile mapping, delta mapping) are common post-processing steps to improve compatibility with local data and impact models. CORDEX-CMIP6 design documents describe the framework and recommended ensembles for regional studies; bias-correction methods range from simple delta adjustments to more sophisticated quantile-mapping techniques (CORDEX-CMIP6 design; UTCDW bias correction guides; quantile mapping methods) [sources listed below].
- Practical takeaways for scope
  - Use an ensemble of downscaled projections across several SSP-RCP combinations to characterize a range of plausible futures. Document the downscaling methods, bias-correction approach, and remaining uncertainties. Where possible, compare multiple downscaled sources to assess the sensitivity of impact projections to the downscaling method itself (Quantifying uncertainty and sensitivity in climate risk assessments; Downscaling methods) [sources listed below].

3) Indicators and measures: exposure, sensitivity (vulnerability), and adaptive capacity
- Exposure indicators
  - Exposure captures the extent to which hazard events occur in places where assets, people, and economic activity are located. Indicators include spatial coincidence of hazards with infrastructure/assets, frequency/intensity of extreme events in exposed areas, and projected changes in these exposures under future scenarios. Practical guidance emphasizes mapping hazard footprints against asset inventories and population distributions (Exposure mapping concepts; ND-GAIN exposure components; Climate Atlas risk basics) [sources listed below].
- Sensitivity (a component of vulnerability)
  - Sensitivity reflects how strongly a system responds to a given hazard, including dependence on climate-sensitive resources, biophysical tolerances, and socio-economic factors (e.g., reliance on rain-fed crops, water stress). Biodiversity/eco-systems literature separates exposure and sensitivity, but applied CCVAs commonly treat sensitivity as a core determinant of impact magnitude. Frameworks vary in how sensitivity is measured, but many use domain-specific indicators such as crop yield dependence, water-use efficiency, or infrastructure fragility to climate variability (Exemplary discussions: vulnerability assessments reviews; IPCC SREX framework) [sources listed below].
- Adaptive capacity indicators
  - Adaptive capacity includes governance, institutions, financial and technological resources, social safety nets, and general readiness to implement adaptation. The Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) provides a widely cited set of indicators partitioned into vulnerability (including exposure, sensitivity) and readiness/adaptive capacity components, with 45 core indicators across 192 countries. This framework is frequently used to compare regional readiness and identify where capacity-building efforts should prioritize (ND-GAIN technical documents) [ND-GAIN sources listed below].
- Integrated frameworks and indicators
  - Several reviews compare CCVAs that use three-element frameworks (E, S, AC) versus two-element approaches, highlighting the need for consistent variable definitions and clear documentation of what constitutes exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity in different sectors (two- vs three-element CCVAs; ESAC framework discussions) [Exposure, sensitivity, or adaptive capacity? Reviewing assessments; ESAC-related work] [sources listed below].
  - Across sectors, vulnerability assessments increasingly incorporate both environmental and socio-economic dimensions, increasingly adopting structured matrices or scoring systems to enable cross-sector prioritization (AdapteCCa guide; vulnerability frameworks in Africa) [sources listed below].

4) Methodologies and practical tools for risk assessment
- End-to-end risk assessment and probabilistic risk characterization
  - Modern climate risk assessments combine hazard, exposure, and vulnerability into a risk metric, often with uncertainty analysis. CLIMADA and similar platforms enable probabilistic, event-based risk estimation by feeding hazard distributions from climate projections, exposure inventories, and vulnerability functions. This end-to-end approach is widely cited as best practice to quantify risk distributions and compare scenarios (e.g., CLIMADA-based assessments) [end-to-end risk framework; CLIMADA references] [sources listed below].
- Vulnerability assessment frameworks
  - The AdapteCCa guide offers a practical vulnerability assessment structure for climate risk analysis, including receptor identification, hazard lists, exposure ratings, vulnerability scores, and risk matrices. It provides a concrete example of how to structure a climate risk assessment table and link vulnerability to exposure and hazard across sectors and receptors (e.g., infrastructure, ecosystems, people) [AdapteCCa guide to climate risk assessment] [sources listed below].
  - The IPCC’s vulnerability/risk literature emphasizes transparent ranking of drivers (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) and explicit treatment of uncertainties; risk guidance documents describe how to communicate risk and uncertainty to decision-makers (IPCC risk guidance) [IPCC risk guidance] [sources listed below].
- Decision support and prioritization frameworks
  - Climate Risk Informed Decision Analysis (CRIDA) is a methodology for water resources planning that explicitly integrates climate and non-climate uncertainties, enabling selection of robust, cost-effective adaptation options under unknowns and variability. It uses a stepwise, participatory process to identify risks, analyze options, and communicate residual risks to stakeholders—helpful for prioritizing adaptation across geographies and sectors with a focus on resilience and reliability (CRIDA) [CRIDA; UNESCO/UN CC:Learn materials] [sources listed below].
  - The Climate Risk Integration Framework (BSR) provides a framework for corporate risk management to integrate climate risks into ERM, including qualitative risk criteria, integration steps, and governance considerations. While aimed at business risk, the framework is transferable for multi-sector, multi-geography adaptation prioritization in the public sector as well (BSR Climate Risk Integration Framework) [BSR framework] [sources listed below].
- Sectoral and information resources
  - World Bank and other resources offer structured climate information resources and screening tools for climate risk, including urban risk assessments, hazard-exposure-vulnerability triads, and climate risk reporting phases. These tools help scale assessments from project-level to city and regional scales, and support the planning and budgeting steps of adaptation action (World Bank climate information resources; Climate Information Resources) [World Bank resources; Climate Information Resources] [sources listed below].

5) A practical, integrated framework for prioritizing adaptation needs across geographies and sectors
A recommended workflow combines the above concepts and tools into a transparent, repeatable process:

- Step 1: Define decision context and boundaries
  - Establish the geographic extents, sectors, time horizons, and decision criteria (risk tolerance, budget, equity considerations). Align with national adaptation plans or city/regional adaptation strategies as applicable (NAP concepts; adaptation planning guidance) [IPCC/UNDP/UNFCCC adaptation planning literature] [sources listed below].
- Step 2: Construct climate scenario inputs and downscale appropriately
  - Select a representative set of climate scenarios using SSP-RCP combinations; obtain regionally downscaled projections (CORDEX-CMIP6) when local detail is needed; document downscaling method and bias-correction approach. This provides hazard projections and their uncertainties for the target scales [CORDEX-CMIP6; SSP-RCP guidance] [sources listed below].
- Step 3: Develop hazard, exposure, and vulnerability profiles
  - Hazard: map projected climate hazards (temperature extremes, heavy rainfall, drought, sea-level rise, etc.) and their frequencies/intensities in study regions.
  - Exposure: inventory critical assets, infrastructure, land uses, and population exposed to the hazards, mapped with spatial overlap.
  - Vulnerability: quantify sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators for each sector and receptor (e.g., agriculture dependence, water stress, governance capacity, financial resources).
  - Use existing frameworks to structure indicators (e.g., AdapteCCa receptor-based tables; ND-GAIN indicators for adaptive capacity) and ensure consistency across sectors and geographies [AdapteCCa; ND-GAIN] [sources listed below].
- Step 4: Quantify risk and uncertainties
  - Combine hazard, exposure, and vulnerability into a risk metric (risk = hazard × exposure × vulnerability) where appropriate, and propagate uncertainties from climate projections, exposure inventories, and vulnerability functions. Use probabilistic or ensemble approaches (e.g., CLIMADA-like methods) to characterize distributions of risk and identify robust options across scenarios [IPCC risk guidance; CLIMADA/end-to-end risk approach] [sources listed below].
- Step 5: Prioritize adaptation actions
  - Apply a multi-criteria decision framework, ranking actions by expected risk reduction, co-benefits (e.g., health, economic resilience), cost-effectiveness, and feasibility. CRIDA offers a practical structure for incorporating uncertainty into option screening and selecting robust solutions across decision contexts; it also emphasizes stakeholder engagement and clear communication of residual risks [CRIDA; UNESCO CRIDA materials] [sources listed below].
  - Use readiness and governance indicators to identify where capacity-building or institutional changes are needed (ND-GAIN readiness indicators; adaptation planning results) [ND-GAIN; adaptation planning literature] [sources listed below].
- Step 6: Plan implementation, monitoring, and iteration
  - Develop an adaptation plan with actions, timelines, budgets, monitoring indicators, and triggers for updating the risk assessment as new information arrives (World Bank climate information resources; adaptation planning frameworks) [World Bank climate information resources; adaptation planning literature] [sources listed below].

Notes on limitations and best practices
- Uncertainty is inherent in climate projections, downscaling methods, and future socio-economic trajectories. Transparent documentation of scenario selection, downscaling choices, and uncertainty analyses is essential to avoid over-precise or misleading conclusions (Quantifying uncertainty and sensitivity in climate risk assessments; IPCC risk guidance) [sources listed above].
- Choosing between exposure–sensitivity–adaptive capacity vs. two-element frameworks depends on data quality and policy needs. Many practical assessments successfully use two-element (e.g., E+AC or E+S) interfaces where data are limited, but three-element frameworks (E+S+AC) provide more nuance and guide targeted adaptation actions (two-element vs three-element CCVAs; vulnerability framework literature) [sources listed above].
- For prioritization, risk-based decision frameworks like CRIDA offer structured, stakeholder-driven processes to identify robust adaptation options in the face of deep uncertainty. They encourage explicit consideration of residual risk and adaptation pathways across geographies and sectors (CRIDA; World Bank risk tools; BSR framework) [sources listed above].

In sum, risk assessment for climate change adaptation should be anchored in a solid vulnerability/exposure/adaptive capacity framework, informed by regional climate projections (preferably downscaled with clear bias correction), and translated into a risk-based prioritization mechanism that guides sectoral and geographic action. The combination of IPCC guidance, vulnerability frameworks (AdapteCCa, ESAC, ND-GAIN), and decision-support tools (CRIDA, BSR framework, CLIMADA) provides a rigorous, scalable approach that policy-makers and planners can adapt to local contexts while maintaining consistency with international best practices.

### 2. Sector-specific adaptation options and pathways
Sector-specific adaptation options and pathways: agriculture, water resources, urban infrastructure and housing, health, and coastal systems

Executive summary
Effective climate adaptation requires sector-tailored strategies that reflect the distinctive risks, technologies, governance contexts, and financial constraints of each sector. Across agriculture, water resources, urban infrastructure and housing, health, and coastal systems, the literature shows:

- A broad menu of technically feasible options exists in each sector (from cultivar improvements and on-farm water management in agriculture to nature-based coastal defenses and urban green infrastructure in coastal/urban contexts). Effectiveness is highly context-specific and often contingent on enabling conditions (financing, governance, information, and capacity) rather than universal prescriptions (IPCC AR6 WGII, AR6 SYR; SRCCL; OECD).
- Costs and benefits are unevenly distributed; cost-benefit analyses and multi-criteria decision frameworks are essential tools for prioritization, especially when non-market effects and distributional impacts matter (EEA, UNFCCC Adaptation Finance Gap Update, FAO/UN Open Knowledge, IPCC discussions).
- Co-benefits and synergies with mitigation are common: investing in adaptation can yield health, air-quality, productivity, and urban livability benefits, and cross-sector planning can yield mutual gains (concept of mitigation co-benefits and adaptation co-benefits; NbS co-benefits in urban/coastal contexts; IPCC cross-cutting chapters).
- Barriers to deployment persist—financing gaps, governance bottlenecks, information and technology access, political commitment, and social equity considerations—though some barriers are more acute in developing countries or highly urbanized settings (IPCC AR6 SYR; AR6 WGII; UNEP Adaptation Gap; IWAR/IEA literature).
- Local experimentation, scale-appropriate design, and nature-based approaches tend to offer favorable cost-benefit profiles when well implemented, though scale, monitoring, and maintenance pose challenges (NbS literature; urban climate governance; coastal NbS vs. gray infrastructure debates).

1) Agriculture: adaptation options, effectiveness, costs, and barriers
What to adapt to and how
- Options with broad feasibility evidence: cultivar improvements and crop diversification; on-farm water management (irrigation efficiency, soil moisture conservation); adaptive water storage; agroforestry; climate services and seasonal forecasting; community-based adaptation and farm/landscape diversification. The IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter on agriculture emphasizes that many options are feasible and effective across contexts, but their success hinges on governance, finance, and information availability (high confidence) [AR6 WGII, Chapter 5; IPCC AR6 SYR summary references]. The SRCCL also stresses the importance of land management and risk-informed decisions in agriculture for climate resilience (high confidence) [SRCCL; AR6 WGII CH 5].
- Emerging or context-specific options: ecological approaches to management (eco-agriculture), risk pooling and insurance, and climate-services uptake to reduce uncertainty in farming decisions [IPCC AR6 WGII; AR6 SPM references].

Effectiveness, co-benefits, and mitigation synergies
- Effectiveness is high in well-supported contexts (extension services, farmer organizations, access to credit). The IPCC notes that some options lack adequate economic or institutional feasibility data or information on limits, underscoring the need for better financing and governance (high/medium confidence depending on modality) [AR6 WGII CH 5; AR6 SPM].
- Co-benefits include enhanced food security, improved soil health and biodiversity, and potential reductions in greenhouse gas intensity through improved nutrient practices and diversification. There are documented synergies between adaptation and mitigation (e.g., diversified systems, agroforestry, reduced waste), though achieving these requires deliberate cross-sector policy design [IPCC AR6 SPM; cross-chapter discussions; literature on mitigation-adaptation co-benefits].
- Nature-based agricultural approaches (e.g., agroforestry, soil carbon management) provide co-benefits for climate resilience and carbon storage, with evidence of multiple benefits in land-based sectors (SRCCL and AR6 discussions).

Costs, financing, and barriers to deployment
- Global costs of adaptation in agriculture are substantial and rising; public and private finance remains insufficient relative to needs (IPCC AR6 WGII and Adaptation Finance Gap literature; UNEP emphasis on finance gaps). The Adaptation Finance Gap Update 2023 estimates plausible central costs of adaptation for developing countries with several hundred billion USD per year ranges when broader sectoral coverage is included (central estimate around US$240 billion/year for this decade with a wide range) [UNFCCC Adaptation Finance Gap Update 2023].
- Barriers include financial constraints, limited access to credit/insurance, knowledge gaps, governance weaknesses, and lack of incentives for private investment. The IPCC explicitly notes barriers such as limited resources and insufficient mobilization of finance to scale adaptation options, especially in developing countries [AR6 SYR; AR6 SPM excerpt].
- Cost-benefit analyses and multi-criteria decision frameworks (MCDA) are increasingly used to prioritize options in agriculture, acknowledging non-market costs/benefits and discounting long-term gains. FAO/FAO-adaptation resources emphasize structured CBA and MCDA as standard tools for prioritization [FAO adaptation literature; open FAO knowledge resources].

2) Water resources: adaptation options, effectiveness, costs, and barriers
What to adapt to and how
- Adaptive water resources management as a core approach: conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater; river basin planning; flexible, iterative decision-making to cope with hydrological uncertainty; emphasis on governance, information, and risk-based planning [Frontiers in Water Resources, 2022; IPCC cross-cutting references].
- Demand management and efficiency improvements: irrigation efficiency, storage and water savings, and improved instrument design (pricing, allocation rules) to reduce stress on water systems.
- Integration with nature-based solutions (NbS) where feasible: wetlands restoration, green/blue infrastructure to enhance resilience to droughts and floods; NbS can provide co-benefits beyond water supply, including ecosystem services and climate adaptation spillovers [IPCC cross-cutting, NbS literature].
- Financial and governance mechanisms: adequate financing, risk-sharing, and institutional capacity to implement long-horizon water projects [UNEP Adaptation Gap, UNEP Finance materials, IPCC SPM].

Effectiveness, co-benefits, and mitigation synergies
- Effectiveness is highly dependent on governance and local conditions; adaptive management and conjunctive use improve resilience where institutions can coordinate across sectors (agriculture, energy, environment) [Frontiers in FRWA 2022; IPCC AR6 SPM references].
- Co-benefits include improved water quality and ecological health, flood risk reduction, and potential mitigation synergies through water-energy-food planning that reduces energy use in pumping and treatment, though explicit quantification varies by case.
- NbS in water management can deliver both adaptation and climate-regulation benefits but require upfront investment and maintenance planning [NbS coastal/urban literature; UN-Water World Water Development Report 2020].

Costs and barriers
- Global adaptation costs for water resources are nontrivial; finance gaps exist for infrastructure, institutional capacity, and data systems; the Adaptation Finance Gap Update highlights underfunded water sector adaptation in developing contexts.
- Barriers include data gaps, governance fragmentation, regulatory hurdles, and the need for cross-sector coordination (water-agriculture-energy). Cost-benefit approaches in EU/EEA and other regions show how non-market benefits matter but can be hard to monetize, affecting political will and funding decisions [EEA; UNFCCC; IPCC SPM].

3) Urban infrastructure and housing: adaptation options, effectiveness, costs, and barriers
What to adapt to and how
- Green/blue infrastructure (NbS) in cities: green roofs and walls, urban trees, parks, wetlands and water-sensitive urban design to reduce urban heat island (UHI), manage stormwater, improve air quality, and enhance microclimates; NbS provide co-benefits for health, biodiversity, and resilience [Larsen and ESAJ references; NbS primer].
- Building codes and climate-resilient design: heat resilience, floodproofing, passive cooling, and materials that withstand extreme events; urban planning frameworks that integrate flood risk, heat, and hazard mapping [IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 6; urban climate adaptation literature].
- NbS versus gray infrastructure: systematic reviews show NbS can be cost-effective and provide multiple co-benefits, but scaling and governance/legal barriers remain (funding, policy integration, and capacity) [NbS synthesis; PLOS One NbS vs gray infrastructure study; coastal NbS literature].
- Governance, communication, and integrated planning: governance innovations, knowledge-sharing, and scenario planning to make urban adaptation more visible and better coordinated with development goals [MDPI Sustainability 2023/2024; urban adaptation governance literature].

Effectiveness, co-benefits, and mitigation synergies
- Green infrastructure provides co-benefits beyond climate adaptation, including air quality improvements, biodiversity, stormwater management, and energy savings; co-benefits often justify upfront investments when properly planned (and can align with mitigation goals through low-carbon urban transitions) [Urban green infrastructure literature; IPCC Chapter 6; NbS primers].
- Mitigation and adaptation synergy is commonly identified in urban plans where climate-sensitive urban design reduces emissions (low-carbon transit, energy-efficient buildings) while boosting resilience; cross-cutting policy alignment is critical to realize co-benefits [IPCC AR6 SPM; city adaptation studies].

Costs and barriers
- NbS deployment faces barriers including long lead times, upfront capital costs, governance fragmentation, and the need to demonstrate performance at scale. Systematic reviews of NbS show a mix of implementation barriers and co-interventions required to scale adoption [NbS literature; Coastal NbS studies].
- Urban housing resilience requires financing for retrofits or new building standards, along with regulatory and land-use changes; policy instruments and incentives greatly influence uptake [OECD urban climate literature; IPCC CH6 references].

4) Health: adaptation options, effectiveness, costs, and barriers
What to adapt to and how
- Health-system strengthening for climate risks: surveillance, early warning, heat-health action plans, disaster risk reduction in health sectors, and resilient health infrastructure; adaptation needs include integration of climate risks into health planning and service delivery [BMC Public Health scoping review 2024; JACI 2023 on health co-benefits and barriers; IPCC references].
- Health co-benefits of mitigation and adaptation actions: reducing air pollution, promoting active transport, improving housing quality, and reducing heat exposure have direct health benefits and can influence health equity [systematic reviews and IPCC cross-cutting results].

Effectiveness, co-benefits, and mitigation synergies
- Health co-benefits are often substantial and can influence the broader economics of climate policy (e.g., reductions in morbidity/mortality from air quality improvements and heat hazard reduction). Studies emphasize that health co-benefits can outweigh costs in some contexts, supporting stronger climate action.

Costs and barriers
- Barriers in health systems include inadequate climate policies, resource constraints, implementation gaps, inequity, and lack of evidence and expertise. Nine thematic barriers emerged in a scoping review of health-system adaptation to climate crises, underscoring the need for investments in governance, capacity, and equitable access to care [BMC Public Health 2024; JACI 2023].
- Integrating climate adaptation with health financing and governance remains challenging, particularly where budgets are constrained or where health systems are overburdened.

- IPCC AR6 cross-cutting references to health co-benefits and climate-resilient health policy

5) Coastal systems: adaptation options, effectiveness, costs, and barriers
What to adapt to and how
- Nature-based coastal defenses vs. gray infrastructure: NbS (living shorelines, oyster reefs, dune restoration, marsh restoration) offer protective benefits against storm surges and erosion while delivering co-benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services; many studies find NbS can be cost-effective and more adaptable than gray infrastructure in certain contexts, though performance is site-specific [NbS primer; PLOS One NbS vs gray infrastructure; coastal NbS systematic reviews].
- Structural defenses where appropriate: seawalls, surge barriers, offshore barriers, and dredging/flood barriers continue to play a role in high-risk coastal zones, particularly where NbS alone cannot meet risk exposure. Successful examples are context-dependent and require maintenance and governance capacity.
- Dutch and European coastal adaptation: case studies on the Netherlands’ dykes, dunes, and flood management illustrate integrated approaches combining hard infrastructure with ecosystem-based strategies; historical and current studies highlight governance and cost considerations in implementing such measures [Koningsveld 2008; Living with Sea-Level Rise case studies].

Effectiveness, co-benefits, and mitigation synergies
- NbS in coastal zones provide multiple co-benefits, including carbon sequestration through coastal ecosystems, biodiversity gains, and social benefits; however, scaling NbS and achieving durable risk reduction require policy integration and long-term financing.
- The combination of co-interventions (policy, governance, finance, and NbS) improves outcomes for coastal resilience [NbS literature; coastal resilience studies].

Costs and barriers
- Barriers to NbS scale include funding constraints, policy integration challenges, and difficulties in scaling proven case studies to larger geographies. The literature emphasizes the need for co-interventions (financing, governance) to unlock full benefits [coastal NbS systematic reviews; NbS primer].
- Costs of gray infrastructure remain significant, and early engagement of communities and cross-sector planning can improve cost-effectiveness by aligning adaptation with development and mitigation objectives.

Cross-cutting themes and policy implications
- Co-benefits and mitigation synergy: Across sectors, adaptation decisions that align with mitigation goals—particularly through cross-sector planning and NbS—offer higher total value and can reduce trade-offs. IPCC synthesis emphasizes the mutual reinforcement of adaptation and mitigation when policy integrates cross-cutting strategies (e.g., low-carbon urban design, nature-based approaches) [IPCC AR6 SPM; AR6 WGII CH6; cross-chapter synthesis].
- Costs, benefits, and decision frameworks: Robust evaluation tools (cost-benefit analysis, MCDA, scenario analysis) help decision-makers prioritize options, incorporate non-market values, and address distributional impacts. EU/EEA materials and UNFCCC guidance emphasize systematic evaluation to guide investment in adaptation [EEA, UNFCCC, FAO MCDA references].
- Barriers and enabling conditions: Financing gaps, governance fragmentation, and information barriers hinder deployment; successful scaling requires finance mobilization, capacity development, policy alignment, and inclusive decision-making that integrates development objectives and climate justice [IPCC AR6 SYR; AR6 SPM; UNEP Adaptation Gap).

Case study highlights
- Nature-based coastal defences vs gray infrastructure: NbS can be cost-effective and deliver co-benefits, but require appropriate governance and monitoring; scaling across coastal regions necessitates co-interventions to address financing and implementation barriers [NbS primer; PLOS One coastal NbS study].
- Urban adaptation in cities: Mitigation co-benefits emerge when cities align adaptation with development and low-carbon pathways; governance structures and incentives matter for uptake [ScienceDirect study on mitigation co-benefits in eight cities; IPCC CH6/Chapter 6 references].
- Agriculture and water: Integrated farm/land-water planning with climate services enhances resilience; political economy and finance limitations shape adoption, with evidence of high potential where incentives and risk transfer mechanisms are in place [IPCC AR6 WGII CH5; Frontiers in FRWA 2022; OECD/FAO agricultural adaptation literature].

Notes and caveats
- Sector-specific options are highly context-dependent. Success depends on enabling conditions such as finance, governance, data, local participation, and capacity-building.
- Cross-sector coordination is essential: single-sector action can underperform if not aligned with other sectors (e.g., water, health, urban planning, and agriculture).
- The literature emphasizes that the costs of inaction (and the distribution of adaptation benefits across groups) are critical components of policy evaluation and project design (EEA, IPCC, UNFCCC). Practitioners should use explicit CBA and MCDA frameworks and transparently consider distributional impacts.

### 3. Governance, policy instruments, and financing for adaptation
Governance, policy instruments, and financing are central to turning climate adaptation from aspiration into scaled action. The literature across global governance, urban policy, finance, and development planning highlights how governance arrangements at multiple scales, an integrated policy mix, and coordinated financing strategies interact with institutional barriers to shape implementation and scale-up. Below is a structured synthesis built from recent syntheses, policy guidance, and empirical studies.

1) Governance arrangements for adaptation: multi-level, polycentric, and integrated
- Global and transboundary governance: Climate adaptation governance has evolved from a largely state-centric, underdeveloped domain in the 1990s to a more plural and multi-actor arena today. There is increasing participation by non-state actors and transboundary considerations, but the domain remains contested. Debates focus on whether global governance arrangements are legitimate or appropriate given sovereignty concerns and the risk of overreach, as well as on the actual effectiveness of global-level actions in shaping local outcomes. This literature emphasizes the diffusion of governance responsibilities across global, regional, national, and subnational actors and the corresponding need for coherent coordination mechanisms (Banda 2018; Wiley/World Bank governance materials) (see sources cited below).
- Urban and metropolitan governance: Cities and metropolitan regions are central sites of adaptation governance due to their exposure to climate risks and their managerial capacity. Research shows that urban adaptation governance increasingly centers on inter-actor coordination, cross-boundary collaboration, and the distributional implications of adaptation policy (e.g., intra-city inequalities, access to resources). The governance literature on metropolitan regions highlights the rise of city networks, federated or polycentric arrangements, and the political processes that shape policy tools and implementation capacity at city scales (Hughes 2015; Long & Rice 2019; Reckien et al. 2018; “governance of climate adaptation in metropolitan regions,” 2024) (see citations below).
- Integration within development and disaster governance: Several frameworks stress “whole-of-government” or integrated governance approaches that embed adaptation within development planning, disaster risk reduction, and sectoral policy cycles. Guidance from OECD and World Bank materials recommends centralizing coordination for adaptation within governing bodies, aligning long-term climate risk considerations with national planning, and clarifying mandates across ministries and agencies to avoid overlaps and gaps (OECD 2009; World Bank climate change governance materials). This integration is frequently framed as essential for coherence across sectors (water, land-use, housing, infrastructure) and for ensuring that adaptation is not treated as a standalone project but as a cross-cutting objective.

2) Policy instruments for adaptation: regulatory, incentive-based, and market-based mixes
- Conceptual framing: Effective adaptation policy usually requires integrated policy mixes that address both market failures and systemic barriers. No single instrument suffices; policy design should balance between supply-side measures (public investments, standards) and market-based/pull mechanisms, while mitigating trade-offs through coordination. Recent work emphasizes the need for anticipatory policy mixes that are coherent across sectors, scales, and time horizons (Gallagher et al.; Rogge et al. 2020s; Meckling & Nahm 2018; Rogge & Schleich 2018). 
- Regulatory (command-and-control) instruments: Building codes, land-use regulations, and mandatory disclosure or information requirements are common regulatory tools. They set minimum standards or obligations to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience, often complemented by sector-specific laws (e.g., water or housing regulations). The IPCC and policy literature describe regulatory instruments as core to providing certainty but sometimes costly or inflexible in rapidly changing contexts.
- Incentive-based instruments: These include subsidies, tax incentives, grants, subsidies for risk reduction, and information programs that nudge actors toward resilient choices. Incentives can work in tandem with information campaigns to address behavioral and institutional barriers and to align short-term actions with longer-term resilience goals (Climate-ADAPT – Economic incentives for behavioural change; EU and CECILIA2050-type work on market-based approaches). 
- Market-based instruments (MBIs): Emission pricing, tradable permits, green procurement, performance-based contracting, and other market-based devices alter the cost-benefit calculus to incentivize adaptation investments and resilience-enhancing behavior. MBIs are often valued for efficiency and scalability, but their design must account for local risk profiles and governance capacity to avoid inequitable outcomes (C2ES market mechanisms; IPCC AR6/AR5 treatments; EU market-based instrument syntheses).
- Policy mix design and pathways: Contemporary scholarship proposes anticipatory policy mix pathways that acknowledge no “silver bullet” instrument exists; instead, mixes should be designed to leverage synergies, reduce political and administrative friction, and align with long-term development and climate goals. This includes balancing regulatory certainty with flexible financial incentives, and designing instruments that support private-sector engagement while maintaining public objectives (Anticipatory Policy Mix Pathways; Rogge et al. 2020s; Meckling & Nahm 2018; Gallagher et al. 2012) (see sources below).

3) Financing mechanisms for adaptation: public funds, concessional/private finance, and blended approaches
- The financing gap and the role of public funds: Global adaptation finance flows have historically lagged far behind estimated needs. Reports estimate billions of dollars in current flows versus hundreds of billions to trillions of annual needs by 2030 in some estimates, underscoring a financing gap, particularly for the most vulnerable countries. Public financing remains critical to catalyze and de-risk private investment, fund capacity building, and finance early-stage adaptation actions.
- Concessional finance and risk-sharing: Concessional terms (grants, below-market-rate loans, guarantees) and de-risking instruments (first-loss capital, guarantees) can reduce downside risk for private investors, helping mobilize private finance for adaptation. However, access to concessional tools is uneven, and country debt sustainability concerns can constrain the scale of private finance mobilization if risk-sharing is not well calibrated (CliF-VI discussions; World Bank guidance; NGFS/DFI working group outputs).
- Blended finance as a mobilization mechanism: Blended finance—combining concessional public/philanthropic funds with private capital—has emerged as a prominent mechanism to crowd in private investment for adaptation. Definitions and frameworks have coalesced around pooled concessional resources used to de-risk and catalyze private finance, with many initiatives focusing on EMDEs. The Enhanced DFI Principles (DFI Working Group) provide a common architecture for blended finance deployments, emphasizing governance, risk, and outcome alignment. Empirical examples show blended finance can unlock investment by addressing perceived risk and liquidity constraints, but it also requires credible metrics, robust due diligence, and consistent standards across investors (NGFS 2023; DFIs’ blended finance literature; NGFS 2023; WEF 2024; Columbia/NCDP analyses).
- Alternative financing instruments and instruments for public financing: Other instruments include green bonds, guarantees, first-loss tranches, and grant-based capital designed to ensure early-stage project viability and capacity-building. Donor and international financial institutions increasingly emphasize grant-based capital and concessional finance to catalyze private investment at scale (CliF-VI; UNDP, Lebanon case; World Bank references). 
- Integration with policy and governance: The effectiveness of financing is tightly linked to governance quality. Without clear allocation of responsibilities, transparent risk sharing, and interoperable accounting and reporting, blended finance and concessional instruments may underperform or misallocate resources. The World Bank’s governance and framework- legislation guidance emphasizes that clear governance structures and policy instruments are prerequisites for leveraging finance effectively.

4) Institutional barriers to implementation and scale-up
- Governance fragmentation and unclear mandates: A recurring theme is the lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities across levels of government, the public/private divide, and the fragmentation of governance portfolios. Competing demands across sectors and short political cycles can hamper long-term adaptation planning and investment decisions (Barriers to climate change adaptation—Governance/policy barriers; Victoria, Australia policy brief; Burkina Faso case; etc.).
- Information, capacity, and data gaps: Access to high-quality information and adaptive capacity at the local level are repeatedly identified as critical bottlenecks. Without reliable hazard data, risk assessments, and technical capacity, even well-designed policies may fail to deliver results, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
- Cross-scale coordination and decision-making: Polycentric governance can offer flexibility and innovation, but it also requires effective coordination across jurisdictions and actors. The literature notes that cross-scale coordination can be weak, leading to misalignment of incentives and scale mismatches between policy design and local needs.
- Integration with development and DRR: The implementation of adaptation measures often competes with development priorities and disaster risk reduction goals. Without institutional alignment, policy coherence across climate, development, and hazard management remains challenging.
- Source examples: Barriers literature (various regional governance studies), California governance finance studies, and policy guidance on integrating adaptation into development planning.

5) Integration with development planning and multi-actor coordination
- The NAP and CRDP processes illustrate how adaptation planning increasingly depends on multi-actor coordination across government, private sector, civil society, and communities. The literature highlights opportunities for coordination and integration but also points to practical constraints—especially in funding, governance, and planning capacities—that can impede progress. The climate-resilient development pathway literature emphasizes the role of NAP processes to mobilize multi-actor action while acknowledging ongoing governance and finance constraints (Nature 2024; related policy analyses).
- Donor coordination and policy alignment: Donors play a critical role in enabling integration into development planning by reforming policy frameworks, aligning incentives, and supporting long-term planning cycles. The OECD guidance (2009) remains relevant for structuring cooperation, donor roles, and the sequencing of adaptation integration.

6) Synthesis: implications for policy design and research needs
- Governance design: An effective adaptation regime requires explicit, clearly delineated roles across scales, strong horizontal and vertical coordination, and legitimacy for cross-border and cross-agency actions. Global-level governance is evolving but remains contested; thus, reliance on well-coordinated national and subnational governance is essential for immediate action, with global collaboration playing a catalytic rather than sovereign-delegating role (Banda 2018; World Bank governance materials).
- Instrument design and policy mixes: A diversified policy mix—regulatory standards, information and capacity-building, subsidies and incentives, and MBIs—tavors resilience across sectors and scales. Integrated policy design should pursue synergies and minimize trade-offs across climate and development objectives. Policymaking should embrace flexible, adaptive governance that can adjust to evolving risk profiles and learning (Gallagher et al.; Rogge et al.; Climate-ADAPT and C2ES syntheses).
- Financing for scale-up: Public finance remains foundational to de-risk and catalyze private investment, particularly for early-stage or highly risky adaptation projects. Blended finance and concessional instruments can mobilize private capital if designed with robust governance, transparent risk-sharing, and measurable outcomes. However, the effectiveness and equity of blended finance depend on credible standards, solid due diligence, and transparent reporting, especially for the most vulnerable countries (NGFS 2023; One Billion Resilient; WEF 2024; CliF-VI; World Bank references).
- Barriers and enabling conditions: Institutional barriers—role ambiguity, misaligned mandates, short political cycles, and data gaps—are central obstacles to implementation. Addressing these barriers requires reform of governance architectures, capacity-building, and streamlining development and disaster risk reduction with adaptation planning.
- Research and practice gaps: There is a need for better empirical evidence on the effectiveness of different policy mixes in diverse settings, more transparent measurement of blended-finance outcomes, standardized metrics for adaptation finance, and improved data ecosystems to support decision-making at local scales. More work on measuring the social equity implications of policy mixes and finance mechanisms is also needed.

Concluding note
The literature consistently signals that adaptation action scales when governance is coherent, policy mixes are thoughtfully designed to leverage synergies across sectors and scales, and financing mechanisms align public resources with private-market participation in a risk-informed, equitable manner. While there is progress in establishing governance and financing frameworks, considerable work remains in harmonizing global ambitions with local realities, ensuring long-term financing, and overcoming institutional barriers that impede scaling up adaptation actions.

### 4. Monitoring, evaluation, and learning for adaptation outcomes
Title: Monitoring, evaluation, and learning for adaptation outcomes: metrics, evaluation design, learning loops, data gaps, and reporting

Introduction
Monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) for climate change adaptation focuses on how adaptation actions translate into reduced vulnerability, increased resilience, and better outcomes for people and ecosystems. A robust MEL architecture helps practitioners track progress, attribute results where possible, learn what works in different contexts, and adapt strategies over time in the face of uncertainty and changing climate risks. The literature and practice converge on a core set of ideas: use a purposeful theory of change or logic model; implement a results-oriented monitoring system (often based on RBM and logframes); design evaluations to test causal pathways while acknowledging uncertainty; embed learning loops that trigger adaptive management; identify data needs and gaps early; and align reporting with national and international transparency requirements. The sources summarized here synthesize these practices and offer concrete tools and examples for implementing MEL in adaptation.

1) Conceptual foundations for MEL in adaptation
- Theory of change and logic models
  - Theory of Change (ToC) helps ground adaptation programs in explicit assumptions about how activities lead to longer-term changes, enabling monitoring and evaluation to test these assumptions over time. UKCIP guidance emphasizes ToC as a robust approach for climate adaptation programming design, monitoring, and evaluation because it situates near-term actions within a flexible, context-specific pathway to impact (ToC Briefing Note; UKCIP). This supports adaptive learning when conditions shift (UKCIP, Theory of Change approach to climate change adaptation programming) [Result 1; Result 3].
  - The ToC approach complements logframes and RBM by making causal assumptions explicit and testable, aiding iterative learning and course corrections (weADAPT overview of M&E for climate change adaptation; theory of change literature) [Result 1; Result 2].

- Monitoring, evaluation, and learning frameworks
  - Results-Based Monitoring (RBM) and the Logframe (LFA) are common tools used to implement RBM in adaptation programs, focusing on outputs, outcomes, and impacts and providing a structured basis for data collection and attribution (weADAPT overview) [Result 1].
  - An evaluation framework for adaptation often includes process indicators (inputs, activities, outputs), outcome indicators (changes in vulnerability, adaptation capacity), and impact indicators (reduction in risk, improved well-being). The M&E Manual for climate change adaptation activities in Vietnam and other national guides illustrate how to structure M&E around national adaptation goals and international commitments (Vietnam M&E manual; NAP Global Network M&E manual) [Result 3; Result 5].

- Adaptive management and learning loops
  - Adaptive management is explicitly framed as “learning by doing,” with iterative cycles that adjust strategies in response to monitoring results and changing conditions. The literature describes adaptive management cycles, double-loop learning, and the importance of governance and social components in overcoming obstacles to learning (We see discussions of adaptive management cycles and double-loop learning in several sources; GLISA Adaptation Monitoring & Evaluation Toolkit reinforces the learning-by-doing logic) [Result 1 (Biological Conservation); Result 4 (GLISA); Result 3 (Theory of Change sources)].
  - Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) or Plan-Do-Study-Adapt cycles are widely used in learning-oriented MEL ecosystems to structure rapid tests of changes and to feed back into program design (PDSA literature from IHI, AHRQ, MN Dept. of Health; NIRN). While not climate-specific, these cycles provide a concrete methodology for testing adaptation interventions and embedding learning into practice (PDSA overviews) [Result 1 (NIRN); Result 2 (PMID-like reviews); Result 4 (AHRQ); Result 3 (Minnesota); Result 4 (IHI)].

2) Key metrics and data needs for monitoring adaptation effectiveness
- Typology of indicators
  - Output indicators: measure completion of activities (e.g., number of capacity-building workshops, currency of hazard maps).
  - Process indicators: track how the adaptation process unfolds (e.g., stakeholder engagement, integration of ToC/decision-making processes).
  - Outcome indicators: reflect changes in vulnerability, resilience, or adaptive capacity (e.g., improved water security, reduced exposure of a vulnerable group, diversification of livelihoods).
  - Impact indicators: demonstrate long-term changes in exposure, risk, and well-being (e.g., reduced climate-related losses, improved health outcomes).
  - Health adaptation indicators: frameworks exist to assess health-system adaptations to climate risks; a literature framework proposes indicators to monitor and evaluate adaptation actions aimed at improving health outcomes and health systems’ resilience (Health adaptation framework with indicator development; PMCID article) [Result 2].
- Data sources and data needs
  - Data typically come from household surveys, administrative records, climate hazard databases, vulnerability assessments, sector-specific datasets, and project-level monitoring systems (Vietnam M&E, NAP MEL Toolkit sections; World Bank and MDB reporting practices).
  - The Global Stocktake/Transparency frameworks (UNFCCC) imply reporting of adaptation progress, necessitating standardized data on adaptation actions, impacts, and finance; this includes the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) and biennial reporting timelines for Parties under the Paris Agreement (ETF readiness and reporting guidance) [Result 3].
  - Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are moving toward shared indicators for climate results, linking adaptation outcomes to resilience results, and disclosing climate finance data at sub-project levels; this institutional trend emphasizes harmonized metrics and data systems to enable comparability across programs and countries (MDB Common Approach; World Bank climate results metrics) [Result 5; Result 3].

- Data gaps and limitations
  - Analysts highlight persistent data gaps in climate-related disclosures and the need for standardized, comparable data to support robust MEL. The NGFS and other monitoring bodies emphasize bridging gaps in climate data, including harmonized disclosure standards and taxonomy to improve reliability and comparability [NGFS progress report; ETF readiness discussions] [Result 5].
  - OECD and adaptation-oriented platforms emphasize integrating climate risks into broader development indicators and ensuring data support for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of adaptation interventions; data gaps can hinder the ability to attribute outcomes to adaptation actions [OECD climate adaptation pages; Evaluation criteria] [Result 1; Result 2].

3) Designing evaluation frameworks for adaptation
- Evaluation design choices
  - Theory-based evaluations: use ToC as a blueprint for identifying causality, testing assumptions, and guiding data collection aligned with intended pathways to resilience and reduced vulnerability (ToC-based guidance by UKCIP; weADAPT synthesis) [Result 1; Result 2].
  - RBM and logframe-based evaluation: track progress toward outputs, outcomes, and impacts, with explicit performance questions and indicators (weADAPT M&E primer; Vietnam M&E manual) [Result 1; Result 5].
  - Health-focused evaluations: frameworks that link adaptation actions to health outcomes and health-system improvements, enabling planning and resource allocation to reduce climate-related health risks (health adaptation framework; PMCID article) [Result 2].
- Learning-informed adaptation
  - MEL should be designed as an iterative loop, where monitoring informs periodic evaluations and decisions about scaling, adapting, or stopping interventions. The GLISA Toolkit and adaptive-management literature emphasize incorporating evaluative learning into policy design and implementation to adapt to local contexts and emerging climate risks (GLISA Toolkit; adaptive management literature) [Result 4; Result 1].
  - PDSA and other learning cycles offer practical templates for rapid experimentation and learning, enabling teams to test changes in small steps, study results, and adjust accordingly before full-scale implementation (PDSA/NIRN/AHRQ summaries) [Result 7 (PDSA); Result 4; Result 1 (NIRN)].

4) Learning loops and adaptive management in practice
- Iterative learning loops
  - Adaptive management frames decisions as a sequence of learning iterations. The literature emphasizes that adaptive management is particularly suitable for climate adaptation due to uncertainty, long time horizons, and complex social-ecological interactions. Double-loop learning helps adjust underlying assumptions and governance structures in addition to actions themselves (double-loop learning, adaptive management cycles) [Result 1 (Springer; Biological Conservation); Result 4 (GLISA); Result 3 (Theory of Change sources)].
  - Learning-by-doing is central to local- and subnational-scale adaptation, where localized MEL can reflect context-specific hazards, vulnerabilities, and governance arrangements (adaptive-management literature; US Climate Resilience Toolkit) [Result 2; Result 1 (US toolkit)].

5) Data gaps and reporting requirements
- Data gaps
  - Global and regional reviews call for improved data availability, consistent climate-disclosure standards, and standardized indicators across agencies and countries. NGFS highlights bridging data gaps in climate-related disclosures, while international frameworks call for harmonized data for transparency and accountability in adaptation progress [NGFS report; UNFCCC ETF materials] [Result 5; Result 3].
- Reporting requirements
  - The Paris Agreement transparency framework (ETF) expects countries to report on adaptation progress and finance, with a move toward standardized formats for comparability. As ETF matures, national MEL systems must align with these formats and ensure data quality, timeliness, and accessibility (UNFCCC ETF; Preparing for the ETF guide) [Result 3].
  - NDC-related reporting and global stocktakes shape national MEL planning, as countries track progress on adaptation commitments and identify gaps to address during stocktakes and subsequent NDC cycles (UNFCCC NDC Synthesis; all-about-NDCs) [Result 1; Result 4].

6) Practical guidance: structuring MEL for adaptation programs
- Start with a clear ToC or logframe
  - Develop a ToC at program design that maps inputs/activities to intermediate outcomes and final impacts, with explicit assumptions about climate risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation mechanisms. Use the ToC as the blueprint for data collection and evaluation questions (UKCIP ToC guidance; weADAPT overview) [Result 1; Result 2].
- Define a monitoring plan with a balanced indicator set
  - Include input/effort indicators, process indicators, and outcome/impact indicators across sectors. Integrate health, livelihoods, and ecosystem metrics where relevant. Use health-adaptation indicator frameworks as one model for capturing outcomes beyond project outputs (health-focused adaptation framework) [Result 2].
- Build adaptive-learning loops into governance
  - Implement adaptive management cycles (plan, test, study, adapt) at multiple scales, incorporating PDSA-style testing for changes and clarifying how lessons will trigger design changes. Use evidence syntheses from the GLISA toolkit and PDSA literature to structure learning processes (GLISA; PDSA sources) [Result 4; Result 7].
- Align MEL with reporting requirements
  - Design MEL systems to feed national and international reporting (ETF, NDC, GST) with standardized data formats and transparent methodologies. Use MDB common approaches for cross-program comparability and to communicate resilience outcomes to stakeholders (MDB Common Approach; World Bank climate results framework) [Result 5; Result 3].

Conclusion
Monitoring, evaluation, and learning for adaptation outcomes require an integrated approach that combines theory-driven design (ToC/logframe), robust indicator sets across outputs, outcomes, and impacts, and iterative learning loops that enable adaptive management. The practical tools—MEL toolkits for NAPs and national adaptation plans, ToC guidance, and adaptive-management cycles—provide pathways to implement MEL that is both rigorous and responsive to changing climate risks. Recognizing data gaps and reporting requirements is essential to ensure that MEL informs policy and practice at local, national, and global scales, contributing to transparent tracking of adaptation progress under the Paris Agreement and related frameworks.

This combination provides a comprehensive basis for designing MEL systems that are both technically robust and practically adaptable to diverse contexts.
- Where possible, practitioners should tailor indicator sets to local contexts and ensure data are disaggregated to reveal equity and inclusion considerations (GESI considerations appear in NAP MEL toolkit acronyms and related materials) [Result 2].

## Limitations and Further Research
Limitations and Further Research
- Uncertainty in climate projections and downscaling methods: require systematic comparisons of SSP-RCP ensembles, bias-correction techniques, and transparent communication of uncertainty to decision-makers.
- Data and indicators gaps: local-scale hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data; consistent sectoral and cross-sector indicators; integration of data across sectors and scales.
- Evidence on option effectiveness: more context-specific cost-benefit analyses and multicriteria decision analyses for agriculture, water, urban systems, health, and coastal adaptation; deeper evaluation of NbS versus gray infrastructure with long-term maintenance considerations.
- Governance and policy design: need empirical work on polycentric, multi-level governance arrangements; evaluation of policy mixes, incentive structures, and cross-sector coordination in diverse settings.
- Financing and MEL integration: assess the real-world effectiveness of blended finance and risk-sharing instruments; develop standardized, transparent MEL metrics for adaptation finance and resilience outcomes aligned with ETF/NDC reporting.
